The eventual goal of this project is to add comment section in your blogs / project with as little hassle as possible using appwrite.  

such that you just install this as
```bash
npm i app-comment
```
then in your layout project
```jsx
// layout.jsx
import CommentSection from "app-comment"
.... your code
<CommentSection postId={slug-of-your-post}>
```
This pkg is available on npm but it has error when importing
